# C# Command Line Parser

![Command Line Parser Logo](docs/images/Banner.png "Command Line Parser Logo")

A simple and light-weight parser for command line arguments, which makes it possible to access parameters
from the command line via well-defined .NET data structures.

Forked from https://github.com/lecode-official/command-line-parser.
